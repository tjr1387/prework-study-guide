        <h2>HTML (the NOUNS of our webpages)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Here are some elements you'll fine within:</li>
            <ul>
              <li> The 'title' element defines the title for a webpage. 
                This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
              </li>
              <li>The 'style' element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
              <li>The 'base' element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>The 'link' element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>The 'meta' element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. Some <i>very common</i> tags:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>'h1' thru 'h6' (headings, 1 being the most prominment -- there should only ever be ONE h1 on a page)</li>
              <li>'p' (paragraph)</li>
              <li>'ul' and 'ol' (unordered lists, and ordered lists) with 'li' (items of the lists) inside them </li>
              <li>'img' (images) which inside the tag requires a 'src' attribute (location of the image), and an 'alt' attribute (text describing the image)</li>
              <li>'a' (links; 'a' means 'anchor'), with a 'href' attribute (the URL/file location the browser will go to when clicked)</li>
              <li>'div' (an unspecific chunk, carved out in a block -- meaning content following this will be bumped onto another line beneath it)</li>
              <li>'span' (an <i>inline</i> chunk, meaning the chunk carved out will stay on one line, and following content can also be on that line</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ** A note on divs/semantics: tags like 'main', 'section' and 'nav' all behave like divs, but add more context to the specific function of those divs.
          Generally, this is good practice. It adds more clarity for other devs looking at your work **

        <h2>CSS (the ADJECTIVES of our webpages)</h2>
        <h3>Some basic CSS properties:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>'margin' indicates how much space we want around the <i>outside</i> of an element.</li>
            <li>'padding' indicates how much space we want around the content <i>inside</i> an element.</li>
            <li>'text-align' is the justification/positioning of the text (i.e. left, center, right)</li>
            <li>'font-weight' is the thickness of the text (can be measured in numbers by the hundred, or names like bold or bolder, e.g.)</li>
            <li>'font-family' is the specific font used (i.e. Arial, Trebuchet, Times New Roman, etc.) -- there are defaults if you don't specify</li>
            <li>'color' is the text color</li>
            <li>'background-color' is the color of the entire background space of the element</li>
          </ul>
          <p>** Colors can be described in a few different ways: pre-set color names (i.e. blue), RGB[A] values, or hex values; VS Code has a very easy-to-use 'color picker' that's point-and-click**</p>
          <h3>Ways to select elements:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Element/tag name</li>
              <li>Class name (preceding the class name with a '.') -- this is more specific than tags, but less specific than IDs</li>
              <li>Id (preceding the id with a '#') -- this is the most specific</li>
            </ul>
          <p>'*' (asterisk) is used to select EVERY element of a page. You can also select the broad-scope tags, like 'html' or 'body', though I haven't seen it done often</p>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <h3>Some common commands (NOT comprehensive/exhaustive):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b [branch-name]: creates a new branch and switches to it
            <ul>
              <li> if the branch already exists, you dont need the '-b' flag there </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>git branch: lists the branches of your current repo, with a * indiciting the currently active branch</li>
          <li>git add [file]: add a file as it currently is to your next commit -- this is also called 'staging' a file</li>
            <ul>
              <li>the '-A' flag will stage all files in the directory.. so far we've used this each time we've 'staged'</li>
            </ul>
          <li>git commit -m "[msg]": commit the staged content, adding a descriptive message about what you're committing</li>
          <li>git clone [URL]: retrieve an entire repo from a hosted location thru the given URL</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls in the base branch into your feature branch to ensure you're up to date -- do this often!</li>
          <p>** MAKE SURE to be on the correct branch even when making changes on your local machine as it may throw off the synchronization between the two.
            This brought to you by 45 mins of rage because I tweaked 'index.html' when Bash had me in the 'feature/starter-code' (I should've been in main)
            Actually I still don't know exactly why that happened. Maybe 'git pull origin main' would've helped? **

        <h2>JavaScript (the VERBS of our webpages) <span class="aside">(editorialized by my arrogance!)</span></h2>
        <h3>Basic JS data-types ('primitives'):</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>string</b> (i.e. text; needs to be in quotes, unlike all other data-types)</li>
            <li><b>number</b> (self-explanatory)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>worth noting that 'NaN' (Not a Number) is considered a 'number' data-type, despite the contradictory name.. lol.. I guess it helps prevent 'cast' errors?</li>
              </ul>
            <li><b>boolean</b> (true or false)</li>
            <li><b>null</b> (void.. nothing.. but do <i>not</i> confuse that for the number zero!)</li>
            <li><b>undefined</b> (this isn't 'nothing' per se; it's what it sounds like; it's nice to have, because it avoids 'crashing' the code in a lot of situations</li>
            <li>there are a few others (BigInt, symbol, etc.) buuut above are the most common ones</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Variables:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>not much to say here -- if you've ever done algebra then you get it -- they're a word used to represent some data</li>
            <li>when assigning one, you need to put 'var' prior to the variable name, then a "=", then the value</li>
            <li>pretty sure we'll eventually be using 'let' (mutable) and 'const' (immutable) to define them, instead of 'var'.. but I could be wrong</li>
          </ul>
        <p>** Quick note about order -- a JS file is read from top to bottom (intuitive), so the order of you code matters! You don't want to reference a variable before you've assigned it! **</p>
        <h3>Conditionals:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>if/else statements which evaluate to a boolean</li>
            <li>the concept of 'truthy' and 'falsy' values; it's easiest just to declare what most (or all?) the 'falsy' values are..</li>
              <ul>
                <li><b>FALSY values:</b> false, 0 (the number), "" (empty string), null, undefined, NaN</li>
              </ul>
            <li>we learned about the STRICT in/equality ('===' and '!=='), but there's also less strict in/equality ('==' and '!=') -- not used as much though</li>
            <li>whichever the first (in order) conditional evaluates to 'true', the remainder of the conditional is skipped</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Arrays <span class="aside">(*cough* LISTS *cough*, ahem, Python.. sorry)</span>:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>sets of values, denoted by square brackets and separated by commas</li>
            <li>they are 'indexed' in order -- just remember that the count starts at <b>ZERO</b> (not one)</li>
            <li>the daya-types in arrays can be different for each item, they can even be other arrays/objects</li>
            <li class="aside" style="font-size: 16px;">yeah.. objects *cough* DICTIONARIES *cough*.. sorry, Python again -- we aren't there yet anyway; let's disregard this for now</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Loops:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>indicated by the 'for' keyword -- they usually pair with arrays, where you go through each item of an array</li>
          <li>3 parts:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>initial expression (assigning a variable to a 'counter')</li>
              <li>a condition (a boolean that must remain true to continue the loop; it'll end once the condition becomes false)</li>
              <li>increment the counter (a shorthand for incrementing by one is '[vbl]++'); the plus one incrememnt is used often</li>
            </ul>
          <li>I'm going to whine for a moment about 'for-of' loops which are much sleeker when you're stepping through an entire array; but we'll get to that in time</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Functions:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>when you know your code will be repeating an action (or series of actions) you can define a function so you don't have to type the logic out each time (this is an example of the concept 'modularizing')</li>
          <li>a function needs to be defined (keyword 'function') and named, with parens following (variables <i>can</i> go into the parens if the function takes an 'argument')</li>
          <li>after opening the curly brace, the logic of the function goes inside</li>
          <li>functions <i>can</i> 'return' values (I believe they return 'undefined' if there's no return statement) -- but we aren't there yet</li>
          <li>remember to actually have the function execute you need to <i>call</i> it (use the function name with parens)</li>
        </ul>
