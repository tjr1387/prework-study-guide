        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Here are some elements you'll fine within:</li>
            <ul>
              <li> The 'title' element defines the title for a webpage. 
                This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
              </li>
              <li>
                The 'style' element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
              </li>
              <li>
                The 'base' element defines the base URL for a webpage.
              </li>
              <li>
                The 'link' element connects an external resource to the HTML document.
              </li>
              <li>
                The 'meta' element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. Some <i>very common</i> tags:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>'h1' thru 'h6' (headings, 1 being the most prominment -- there should only ever be ONE h1 on a page)</li>
              <li>'p' (paragraph)</li>
              <li>'ul' and 'ol' (unordered lists, and ordered lists) with 'li' (items of the lists) inside htem </li>
              <li>'img' (images) which inside the tag require a 'src' attribute (location of the image), and an 'alt' (text describing the image)</li>
              <li>'a' (links; 'a' means 'anchor'), with a 'href' attribute (the URL the browser will go to when clicked)</li>
              <li>'div' (an unspecific chunk, carved out in a block -- meaning content follow we be bumped onto another line beneath it)</li>
              <li>'span' (an <i>inline</i> chunk, meaning the chunk carved out will stay on one line, and followign content can also be on that line</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A note on divs/semantics: tags like 'main', 'section' and 'nav' all behave like divs, but add more context to the specific function of those divs.
          Generally, this is good practice. It adds more clarity for other devs looking at your work

          <p>MAKE SURE to be on the correct branch even when making changes on your local machine as it may throw off the synchronization between the two.
            This brought to you by 45 mins of rage because I tweaked 'index.html' when Bash had me in the 'feature/add-starter-code' (I should've been in main)
            Actually I still don't know exactly why that happened.
