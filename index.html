        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Here are some elements you'll fine within:</li>
            <ul>
              <li> The 'title' element defines the title for a webpage. 
                This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
              </li>
              <li>The 'style' element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
              <li>The 'base' element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>The 'link' element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>The 'meta' element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. Some <i>very common</i> tags:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>'h1' thru 'h6' (headings, 1 being the most prominment -- there should only ever be ONE h1 on a page)</li>
              <li>'p' (paragraph)</li>
              <li>'ul' and 'ol' (unordered lists, and ordered lists) with 'li' (items of the lists) inside them </li>
              <li>'img' (images) which inside the tag require a 'src' attribute (location of the image), and an 'alt' (text describing the image)</li>
              <li>'a' (links; 'a' means 'anchor'), with a 'href' attribute (the URL the browser will go to when clicked)</li>
              <li>'div' (an unspecific chunk, carved out in a block -- meaning content following this we be bumped onto another line beneath it)</li>
              <li>'span' (an <i>inline</i> chunk, meaning the chunk carved out will stay on one line, and following content can also be on that line</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A note on divs/semantics: tags like 'main', 'section' and 'nav' all behave like divs, but add more context to the specific function of those divs.
          Generally, this is good practice. It adds more clarity for other devs looking at your work

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <h3>Some basic CSS properties:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>'margin' indicates how much space we want around the <i>outside</i> of an element.</li>
            <li>'padding' indicates how much space we want around the content <i>inside</i> an element.</li>
            <li>'text-align' is the justification/positioning of the text (i.e. left, center, right)</li>
            <li>'font-weight' is the thickness of the text (can be measured in numbers by the hundred, or names like bold or bolder, e.g.)</li>
            <li>''font-family' is the specific font used (i.e. Arial, Trebuchet, Times New Roman, etc.) -- there are defaults if you don't specify</li>
            <li>'color' is the text color</li>
            <li>'background-color' is the color of the entire background space of the element</li>
          </ul>
          <p>** Colors can be described in a few different ways: pre-set color names (i.e. blue), RGB[A] values, or hex values**</p>
          <h3>Ways to select elements:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Element/tag name</li>
              <li>Class name (preceding the class name with a '.')</li>
              <li>Id (preceding the id with a '#') -- this is the most specific</li>
            </ul>
          <p>'*' (asterisk) is used to select EVERY element of a page. You can also select the broad-scope tags, like 'html' or 'body', though I haven't seen it done often</p>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b [branch-name]: creates a new branch and switches to it
            <br>   ** if the branch already exists, you dont need the '-b' flag there **
          </li>
          <li>git branch: lists the branches of your current repo, with a * indiciting the currently active branch</li>
          <li>git add [file]: add a file as it currently is to your next commit -- this is also called 'staging' a file</li>
          <li>git commit -m "[msg]": commit the staged content, adding a descriptive message about what you're committing</li>
          <li>git clone [URL]: retrieve an entire repo from a hosted location thru the given URL</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls in hte base branch into your feature branch to ensure you're up to date -- do this often</li>
          <p>MAKE SURE to be on the correct branch even when making changes on your local machine as it may throw off the synchronization between the two.
            This brought to you by 45 mins of rage because I tweaked 'index.html' when Bash had me in the 'feature/add-starter-code' (I should've been in main)
            Actually I still don't know exactly why that happened. Maybe 'git pull origin main' would've helped?
