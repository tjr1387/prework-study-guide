# Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The intention of this page is is to consolidate the main ideas of our course pre-work into one semi-organized spot for Bootcamp Students to peruse. Though we didn't go too in-depth, there was still a whole lot information given about the basics of web development. We covered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) and how they work together to make a functional webpage. We also experienced the GitHub workflow throughout the process. This page contains some notes on each of those four topics, with a few unnecessary asides from yours truly, who has a wee bit of prior experience with some topics.

## Usage

Each of the four topics (HTML, CSS, JS, Git) is contained within its own boxed section. Within each are some very basic notes; the Git section being the least useful (the way I set it up) and the JavaScript section being the most fleshed out. If you open the DevTools, you can see a couple of JS functions at work in the console: One of them lists the sections, and the other (randomly) suggests a topic to review first. You can ignore the purple comments if they don't make sense to you. They are spots where I get ahead of the pre-work, due to having experienced JS (and Python, a different programming language) a bit prior to this course.
